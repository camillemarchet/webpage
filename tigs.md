# First blog post: all about the -tigs!
Following a recent discussion on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bioinfochat/status/1252912873698988035?s=20), I decided to do a high-level presentation of the population of -tigs sequences we encounter lately in k-mers related-papers (counting, assembly, indexing...). I'll mostly cover unitigs, simplitigs and their twin USTs, monotigs, omnitigs but also very related sequences such as super-k-mers.

## Introduction

## Unitigs: the old classic

## Simplitigs and USTs: harder better longer longer

## Monotigs: keep the counts

## Omnitigs (and contigs): buckle up for assembly 

## Disjointings
